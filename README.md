# Harry's Wishlist

These are listed in order of most wanted, to least wanted.

I will be happy with any gift, it doesn't have to be on this list, the gift of Christmas is enough! In saying that this is a list of things that I want but could never bring myself around to buying.

I will keep this list updated, so if something isn't in your price range, or just not confident on it, check back.

1. [Onyx Nova Air 2](https://shop.boox.com/en-au/products/novaair2) - *~$600*
 - Alternative [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) *~$600*
 - Either is good, the remarkable 2 is easier to get and has a larger screen. I don't think the Nova Air2 is out yet.
 - The big point is needing the marker or pen, I plan to annotate books and take notes etc.
2. [Creality Ender 3 V2](https://www.amazon.com.au/Creality-Motherboard-Meanwell-Carborundum-220x220x250mm/dp/B07FFTHMMN) - *~$350*
 - My old 3D printer broke so this is a good one to grab. 
3. [Parabolic Grid Antenna](https://www.access12voltwarehouse.com.au/products/19dbi-grid-parabolic-antenna-for-2-3ghz-2-4ghz-2-5ghz) *~$80-$150*
 - This will be used to pull images off satellites. This the linked one is one that I found in stock. You can get it cheaper, but they are on back order.
 - Better to skip this one if you're unsure as the requirements are specific.
4. [Strapcode SRPD Jubilee](https://www.strapcode.com/products/strapcode-watch-bands-metal-ss-bcl20-b117) *~$80*
 - For my watch!
 
 If I don't get anything off this list, I will still be extremely happy. This is just meant as a guide.
